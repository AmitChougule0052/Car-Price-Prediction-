Car Price Prediction Using ML Model 

## Problem Context : 

   It’s often hard to know the right price of a car because it depends on many things like the brand, model, age, mileage, and fuel type. Without the right tools, people may end up paying too much or selling for 
   too little. A car price prediction system uses machine learning to look at all these details and give a fair price, helping both buyers and sellers make better decisions.

## Content : 

   The dataset includes various details about cars such as:

   • Brand and model

   • Year of manufacture

   • Fuel type and transmission

   • Engine size and mileage

   •  Selling price
   

## Features : 

  • Car Name / Brand – The make and model of the car

  • Year – The year the car was manufactured

  • Fuel Type – Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric, etc.

  • Transmission – Manual or Automatic

  •  Mileage – How far the car has been driven

  •  Engine Size – Size or capacity of the engine

  •  Number of Owners – How many previous owners

  •  Selling Price – Target variable to be pred


## Mapping Business Problem to the ML Problem :

    The business goal is to help people estimate the right selling price of a car based on its features. We can solve this using supervised machine learning, where the input is car details (like brand, year, 
    mileage, etc.), and the output is the car’s price.

    This becomes a regression problem in machine learning because the target variable (price) is continuous. The model learns patterns from historical data to predict the price of a new or used car accurately.
